# Nomos (Greek for "Law") System Files

These are my various system files that drive system configuration(s).

## Install

### 1. Clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgttech/nomos.git ~/.nomos
```

### 2. Install:

This does the initial installation, configuration, and setup of the environment.

**[REQUIRED]**
You NEED to completely close you active running shell and RE-OPEN a new shell instance after this is done installing.

```bash
~/.nomos/install.sh
```

### 2. Enable:

This sets up the initial symbolic links. Once this step is done, you need to log out and then back in.

```bash
~/.nomos/enable.sh
```
